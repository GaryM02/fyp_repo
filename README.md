# An AI-Driven Trustworthiness Prediction System for Online, Text-Based Medical Content
**Goal** - This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that evaluates the credibility of online, text-based medical content. 
Using a fine-tuned Transformer model and explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as LIME, the system will provide users with trustworthiness scores and explanations for its predictions. 
Delivered via a Chrome Extension with a React-based interface and FastAPI backend, this tool will help users make informed decisions about online medical information.
